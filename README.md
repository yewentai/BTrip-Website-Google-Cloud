# Distributed Systems Lab: Deploying Java RMI, SOAP, and REST Services

This project is part of the Distributed Systems course and focuses on deploying and testing Java-based remote services using RMI (Remote Method Invocation), SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), and REST (Representational State Transfer) on Azure Virtual Machines. This exercise allows students to gain hands-on experience with cloud-based deployment using IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and understanding the nuances of distributed applications across global data centers.
